# **PyBer_Analysis**

## Overview of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to determine data regarding rides per city type. Based on the data a graph was created to show the trend of ride fare by city type for each month.

## Results

Based on the summary dataframe, we can see that while Rural rides are far less frequent than Urban rides, they typically have a higher average fare per ride. However because of the volume difference between Rural and Urban total rides, Urban rides produce a higher revenue in total fares.

While looking at the multiple-line chart, we can see that all three ride/city types tend in similar patterns.

## Summary

Based on the analysis above, I would recommend the following to the CEO of PyBer to address disparities between city types:

**1.** I would suggest a workgroup to discuss who could be done to intice more residents in rural areas to use the PyBer ride services more frequently.

**2.** I suggest doing a review on like type cities to ensure that average fares are similar as it looks like some like type cities have more fare differences. This can be seen with Lake Johnathanshire compared to the other four like city types that are displayed.

**3.** I would also suggest considering offering promotions to riders during the times when riding frequency and fare totals are lower.
